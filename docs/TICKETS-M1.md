# M1 — Core editor (actionable tickets)

Milestone goal: open, edit, and save a real `.md` file, with live Markdown styling and
a working HTML preview. Each ticket is small and has a verify step. Do them in order.

Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[x]` done. Keep `swift build` and `swift run mdcheck` green.

---

- [x] **M1-0 — Buildable skeleton.** SPM package, `MarkdownCore` on swift-markdown,
  AppKit app opening one window with an `NSTextView`, `mdcheck` smoke test.
  *Verify:* `swift build` succeeds; `swift run mdcheck` prints "mdcheck passed". ✅ done.

- [x] **M1-1 — `NSDocument` document model.** Replace the hardcoded window with an
  `NSDocument` subclass (`MarkdownDocument`) + `NSDocumentController`, registered for
  `.md`/`.markdown`/`.txt` (UTType `net.daringfireball.markdown`, `public.plain-text`).
  Read/write plain UTF-8. Hook up the standard File menu (New/Open/Save/Save As).
  *Verify:* launch, ⌘N, type, ⌘S to a `.md` file, reopen it — content round-trips.
  Also closes INF-1: `open -a build/Aeris.app some.md` opens that file in a window.
  Requires adding an app menu + `Info.plist` document types (document the Xcode-project
  vs SPM-resources approach you choose). *Chosen: SPM only, no Xcode project —
  `scripts/bundle.sh` copies `Resources/Info.plist` into `build/Aeris.app`; the menu is
  built in code (`MainMenu.swift`). `open -a` needs an absolute app path on this macOS.*

- [x] **M1-2 — Editor view object.** Extract the `NSTextView` into an
  `EditorViewController` owning the text storage, wired to the document's content
  (two-way). Monospaced, plain text, 24pt insets, soft-wrap.
  *Verify:* edits update the document (dirty state ⌘S works); no rich-text pasteboard.

- [x] **M1-3 — Live Markdown styling.** *(revision 1 verified headlessly; in-app recheck of fence typing pending.)* On text change, parse with `MarkdownCore` and
  apply `NSAttributedString` attributes for headings, bold, italic, inline code, links,
  lists — styling the *source* text in place (iA-style), not replacing it. Debounce /
  incremental: re-style only affected paragraphs (see architecture map §3).
  *Verify:* typing `# H` enlarges the line; `**x**` bolds; stays responsive on a long doc.

- [ ] **M1-4 — Per-document metadata in xattrs.** Store/restore cursor + scroll
  position in extended file attributes on save/open (never in file content).
  *Verify:* reopen a file — caret and scroll are where you left them; the `.md` bytes
  are unchanged (diff shows no added front-matter). *(built 2026-10-29, verified headlessly; awaiting UI check.)*

- [ ] **M1-5 — Full HTML rendering in `MarkdownCore`.** Extend the AST→HTML walker to
  cover the rest of CommonMark + GFM we need: code blocks, block quotes, links, images,
  tables, task lists, thematic breaks. Add XCTest cases per node type.
  *Verify:* `swift run mdcheck` (extend it) + `swift test` on Xcode/CI all green. *(mdcheck green 2026-10-28; XCTest pending CI, INF-2.)*

- [x] **M1-6 — `WKWebView` preview pane.** Split view: editor left, `WKWebView` right
  rendering `MarkdownCore.html(text)` wrapped in a themeable HTML template (light/dark
  CSS). Update on edit (debounced).
  *Verify:* type Markdown, see it render live; dark mode follows system.

- [ ] **M1-7 — Editor↔preview scroll sync.** *(built 2026-10-29, verified headlessly; awaiting UI check.)* Keep the preview roughly aligned to the
  editor's visible range as you scroll/type.
  *Verify:* scrolling the editor moves the preview to the matching section.

### Infrastructure (unblocks validation; do alongside M1)

- [x] **INF-1 — App bundle script.** `scripts/bundle.sh`: wraps the `swift build`
  binary into `build/Aeris.app` with an `Info.plist` (bundle id, document types for
  `.md/.markdown/.txt`, `aeris://` URL scheme). `swift run` stays the fast path.
  *Verify:* `scripts/bundle.sh && open build/Aeris.app` launches; Finder opens a
  `.md` with it.

- [ ] **INF-2 — CI.** *(workflow file written 2026-10-29; needs a GitHub remote + push from H.)* `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on `macos-latest`: `swift build`,
  `swift run mdcheck`, `swift test`. This is the only place XCTest runs today.
  *Verify:* green check on a pushed commit.

- [x] **INF-3 — Fixtures.** `Tests/Fixtures/*.md`, one per node type we render;
  `mdcheck` and XCTest both load them so the two suites can't drift.
  *Verify:* `swift run mdcheck` reports one line per fixture.

Exit criteria for M1: open a real `.md`, edit with live styling, see live preview,
save (content clean, cursor restored). Then start M2 (library/organizer).

## Follow-ups decided by H (2026-10-29)

- [ ] **M1-8 — Auto-detect text encoding.** Opening a non-UTF-8 file (e.g. Latin-1 /
  Windows-1252 `.txt`, UTF-16 with BOM) detects the encoding instead of refusing.
  Save writes back in the same encoding, so the file is never silently re-encoded.
  Detection lives in `MarkdownCore` (pure, tested); `MarkdownDocument` uses it.
  *Verify:* mdcheck cases for UTF-8, UTF-8 BOM, UTF-16 LE/BE BOM, Windows-1252 with
  accents; open a Latin-1 file → text correct; edit, save → `file -I` still reports the
  original charset and bytes outside the edit are unchanged.

- [x] **M1-9 — Smart punctuation in the preview.** Render `"quotes"` → “quotes”,
  `'` → ’, `--` → –, `---` → —, `...` → … (swift-markdown smart opts on). The `.md`
  source is never changed. Code spans and code blocks stay literal.
  *Verify:* update fixtures; mdcheck asserts curly quotes in prose and straight quotes
  inside `code`.

- [ ] **M1-10 — External changes to the open document (H, 2026-10-29).** When another
  app or process changes, replaces, moves or deletes the file of an open document,
  Aeris detects it (NSFilePresenter via NSDocument: `presentedItemDidChange`,
  `presentedItemDidMove`, `accommodatePresentedItemDeletion`, comparing the file
  modification date and contents so our own saves never trigger it) and shows a
  window-modal sheet:
  - **Reload** replaces the editor text with the version on disk (undoable, caret kept
    near its old position).
  - **Ignore** keeps the editor text. The next save writes it over the disk version
    without NSDocument's "changed by another application" error, because the user
    already chose.
  When the document has unsaved edits, the sheet says so, and Reload warns those edits
  will be lost. Several changes while the sheet is up collapse into one prompt. A move
  or rename follows the file silently (title updates). A deletion asks
  Keep (re-save on next save) / Close. Never auto-reload without asking, and never
  lose the user's text without an explicit Reload.
  *Verify:* self-check with a temp file: an external write fires exactly one prompt,
  and our own ⌘S/autosave fires none. Reload → text matches disk, ⌘Z restores the old
  text. Ignore → disk unchanged until save, then save writes ours with no error sheet.
  Two quick external writes → one prompt. On screen: edit the file in another editor
  while it is open in Aeris.
