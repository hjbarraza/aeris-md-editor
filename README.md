# aeris-md-editor

A free, native macOS Markdown editor. Plain `.md` files on disk, local-first, no
accounts.

## Status

Early development. Editor with live styling, live preview, formatting commands and a
library sidebar work today. Roadmap in `docs/PLAN.md`, tickets in `docs/TICKETS-*.md`,
architecture in `docs/ADR-001-appkit-primary.md`.

```
swift build            # build
scripts/bundle.sh debug && open build/Aeris.app   # build and run the app bundle
swift run mdcheck      # verify the Markdown pipeline (works on Command Line Tools)
swift test             # full XCTest suite (needs full Xcode)
```
